This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data. 

The data sources is as follows;

# Here are the data for the project:

# Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear 
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the 
data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for 
generating the training data and 30% the test data.  

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by 
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass 
filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a 
filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from 
the time and frequency domain.

#The Data and variables are as follows;

The dataset includes the following files:

1.  features.txt:  List of all features.
2.  activity_labels.txt:  Links the class labels with their activity name.
3.  x_test.txt:  Test set
4.  y_test:  Test lables
5.  x_train.txt Training set
6.  y_train.txt Training labels
7.  subject_test.txt:  Indentifies the subject who performed the activity for each sample. 
8.  subject_train.txt: Indentifies the subject who performed the activity for each sample. 

# Transformation Details

1.  Merged the training and the test sets to create one set.
2.  Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.  Used descriptive activity names to name the activites in the datasets.
4.  Labeled the dataset wtih descriptive activity names.
5.  Created a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Requriements to run run_analysis.R script.

1.  Requires data.table and dplyr libaries.
2.  Load test and train datasets.
3.  Load Features and activity labels datasets.
4.  Extract mean and standard deviation column names and data.
5.  Process and merge datasets.
6.  Generate tidy_set.txt tidy file.
