This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data. 

#The Data and variables are as follows;

The dataset includes the following files and variables:

1.  features.txt:  List of all features.
2.  activity_labels.txt:  Links the class labels with their activity name.
3.  x_test.txt:  Test set
4.  y_test:  Test lables
5.  x_train.txt Training set
6.  y_train.txt Training labels
7.  subject_test.txt:  Indentifies the subject who performed the activity for each sample. 
8.  subject_train.txt: Indentifies the subject who performed the activity for each sample. 

# Transformation Details

1.  Merged the training and the test sets to create one set.
2.  Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.  Used descriptive activity names to name the activites in the datasets.
4.  Labeled the dataset wtih descriptive activity names.
5.  Created a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
